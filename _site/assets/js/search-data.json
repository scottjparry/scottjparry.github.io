I was initially thinking a Racoon, you know, looks permanently exhausted, always has its hands full, non-zero chance that it might bite you! I realised that the Cuttlefish better embodies the modern cybersecurity team, they dont rely on brute force or thick armor like a saltie, they survive through their intelligence, ability to adapt to any situation…and they are kind of clever, sound familiar to you? . Yes…you just got compared to a cephalapod! In a good way I promise… . ",

I want cybersecurity to be accessible to anyone that works with technology, my pet peeve is when people say “its not my job” or “I don’t understand”, i’m making it my mission to make cybersecurity more accessible.
