# Why the animal theme?

I chose animal themes — particularly oceanic ones like the cuttlefish — because they reflect the nature of cybersecurity work: adaptive, intelligent, and often operating in the unseen depths. The ocean is vast and complex, just like the cloud. Plus, let’s be honest — security blogs are more fun with tentacles.
