    "content": "It‚Äôs late at night, you sit down at your desk, the low hum of the fan the only noise in an otherwise quiet house. Then you hear a radio crackle to life. You think to yourself thats strange‚Ä¶I dont have a radio‚Ä¶ . A crackly news broadcast echoes through the empty room . ‚ÄúEmergency weather forecast. Light rain. Strange analogies. Residents are urged to prepare coffee. Cuttlefish have been spotted in trench coats. They are demanding coffee in exchange for knowledge‚Äù . By now you‚Äôre wondering why I chose a cuttlefish as our guide on this cybersecurity journey. If you‚Äôre not, then the whole paragraph has no point and that would be a shame. I was initially thinking a Racoon, you know, looks permanently exhausted, always has its hands full, non-zero chance that it might bite you! That reminded me of a cybersecurity team! I realised that the Cuttlefish better embodies the modern cybersecurity team, they dont rely on brute force or thick armor like a saltie, they survive through their intelligence, ability to adapt to any situation‚Ä¶and they are kind of clever, sound familiar to you? . Yes‚Ä¶you just got compared to a cephalapod! In a good way I promise‚Ä¶ . ",

I know there is a better way. Security does not have to scary, cloud computing doesnt have to be cloudy (hmmm - ill work on that) and Frameworks dont need to be oppressive. I want cybersecurity to be accessible to anyone that works with technology, my pet peeve is when people say ‚Äúits not my job‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand‚Äù, i‚Äôm making it my mission to make cybersecurity more accessible.
