# 👋 Welcome to Parrybytes!

What's up? **Looks at the sky** - yeah I know...its a bad joke- you'll get used to it...

If you haven't met me before my name is Scott, I'm a recovering Systems Engineer turned Cloud Architect working for a leading Microsoft Partner in Sydney. I spend my (work) days adapting to and navigating the shifting currents of cloud security.

## The Cuttlefish

It's late at night, you sit down at your desk, the low hum of the fan the only noise in an otherwise quiet house. Then you hear a radio crackle to life. You think to yourself thats strange...I dont have a radio...

A crackly news broadcast echoes through the empty room

"Emergency weather forecast. Light rain. Strange analogies. Residents are urged to prepare coffee. Cuttlefish have been spotted in trench coats. They are demanding coffee in exchange for knowledge"

By now you're wondering why I chose a cuttlefish as our guide on this cybersecurity journey. If you're not, then the whole paragraph has no point and that would be a shame. I was initially thinking a Racoon, you know, looks permanently exhausted, always has its hands full, non-zero chance that it might bite you! That reminded me of a cybersecurity team! I realised that the Cuttlefish better embodies the modern cybersecurity team, they dont rely on brute force or thick armor like a saltie, they survive through their intelligence, ability to adapt to any situation...and they are kind of clever, sound familiar to you?

Yes...you just got compared to a cephalapod! In a good way I promise...

## What makes me tick?

I've got my tentacles dipped into several digital ponds
- I wrestle with Microsoft Azure until it behaves
- I fortify Microsoft 365 environments (but still keep them usable)
- I make sense (or try to) of cybersecurity frameworks and get rid of the headaches
- I build cloud security solutions that work in the real world and not just the ivory tower.

## Why am I writing

Honestly, we have all been through the same mind-numbing presentations where we have no (sentence enhancer goes here) idea what is being talked about, its acronym soup with a heaping side of jargon and at this point you're not even sure they are speaking english let alone making sense. I know there is a better way. Security does not have to scary, cloud computing doesnt have to be cloudy (hmmm - ill work on that) and Frameworks dont need to be oppressive.

I want cybersecurity to be accessible to anyone that works with technology, my pet peeve is when people say "its not my job" or "I don't understand", i'm making it my mission to make cybersecurity more accessible.

## What you can expect here

This blog will try and cut through the noise, we aren't playing buzzword bingo after all, I wont participate in fear mongering.

What we will try and do

- Provide practical security advice from the Mariana (mmmmm Marinara) trenches
- Investigate the adventures and misadventures of cybersecurity
- Have detailed breakdowns of cybersecurity frameworks which actually make sense
- Review cloud conundrums and their solutions without the wet blanket
- Enjoy lots of terrible puns and animal references which hopefully make sense to you as well.

## Pull up a chair

Whether you're a hardened security veteran, curious about what makes the cloud Tik-Tok or even if you work in *whispers* sales (I wont judge) you're welcome here. We'll explore together, share some laughs and try and find some better ways to do this.

I'm just going to duck off and make a coffee (My favourite is "Lots") and then we can dive in and explore Cybersecurity, with less doom and gloom and more "Ah, I get it now!"
