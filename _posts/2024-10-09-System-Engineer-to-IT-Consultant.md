{:toc}

## 1. Trust Your Technology Skills

As a system engineer, you've spent years in the trenches mastering various technologies, troubleshooting complex issues, and architecting solutions. Don't underestimate the value of your technical expertise. In the world of IT consulting, clients seek professionals who can provide expert guidance on technology-related matters. Your broad and deep knowledge in this area is a valuable asset that will set you apart from the competition. If you have kept your skills up to date to support your employer you can keep up to date with the latest industry trends and advancements to support your future customers.

## 2. Focus on Business Skills, Including Presentations

While your technical skills are essential a successful IT consultant also possesses strong business acumen. Learning to speak the language of your clients is essential, whether that is honing your communication, negotiation or project management skills. Effective presentation skills are also particularly crucial as they enable you to clearly convey complex technical information to non-technical stakeholders. You should invest time in improving your ability to articulate your ideas, proposals and solutions.


## 3. Expectation Management 

In the consulting world, managing expectations is paramount. You have to be transparent and realistic when discussion project timelines, deliverables and potential challenges with clients. Making sure you set accurate expectations from the beginning will help to build trust and prevent misunderstandings down the road. Effective expectation management is a key element of successful client relationships. This may seem daunting, but you have likely been doing this for internal projects already.

## 4. Understand the "Why"

Being a good IT consultant must go beyond the technical problem-solving. You need to take the time to understand the underlying business goals and objectives your client is trying to meet. Your technical solution should align with their strategic vision. If you can move beyond problem-solving and also help the client meet their business objectives, you become a trusted partner rather than just a service provider.

## 5. Realize You've Already Been Consulting

While you have likely never officially held the title of "consultant," if you are employed as a systems engineer, you've most likely provided consulting-like services to internal teams or clients. Reflect on your past experiences where you have offered guidance, made recommendations for solutions, or helped others to solve a problem. These instances all demonstrate the same abilities that consultants use, even if it was informal. Recognizing your existing experience in consulting can boost your confidence when you make the transition. It definitely helped me!

## Conclusion 

Transitioning from a systems engineer to an IT consultant is an exciting journey that allows you to leverage your existing skills while greatly expanding your horizons. Trust in your technical expertise, continue to develop your business skills, master expectation management, understand the "why" behind the solution, and realize you've already been consulting. With the five key themes in mind, embrace your new role as an IT consultant with confidence and enthusiasm. Your own unique combination of technical skills and consulting mindset will undoubtedly lead to a successful and fulfilling career in IT consulting.
