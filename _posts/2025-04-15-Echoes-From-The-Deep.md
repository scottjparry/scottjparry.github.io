ðŸª¸ Echoes from the Deep

Cloud security doesn't exist in a vacuumâ€”though sometimes it feels like we're screaming into one. Echoes from the Deep is where I step back from the console and look at the horizon. These posts explore strategic shifts in the industry, macro trends in risk, regulatory rumblings, and the tectonic movements shaping how cloud security is bought, built, and defended.

Think of it as sonar for the security-conscious: mapping out whatâ€™s coming before it hits the hull. If you're a senior architect, CISO, or anyone who needs to justify a security roadmap to people who really like Excel, this is your corner of the reef.
