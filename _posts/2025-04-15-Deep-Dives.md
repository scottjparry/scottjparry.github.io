ðŸ¦‘ Deep Dives

This is where we put on the tech tanks and descend into the murky brilliance of cloud architecture. Deep Dives covers the gnarlier bits: config drift detection, Entra ID internals, Defender for Cloud patterns, and the kind of PowerShell sorcery that makes auditors cry tears of joy (or fearâ€”itâ€™s a fine line).

Expect high signal, low fluff, and no apologies for going long. If it's technical debt you're trying to untangle, or a design decision youâ€™re ready to make with eyes open, this is where we get into the weedsâ€”well, kelp forests, really.
