🥽 Snorkelling


Let’s face it—most cloud security advice either assumes a unicorn budget or requires psychic powers to decipher vague “zero trust principles.” Snorkelling is my antidote to that. These posts live close to the surface, where delivery meets reality. They’re grounded in real-world engagements, lessons from actual tenants, and yes, the odd bruised ego (mostly mine).

Whether you're tuning a Conditional Access policy mid-incident or explaining to someone why MFA fatigue is a thing and not a vibe, you'll find practical value here. The waters are clear, the advice is usable, and the sarcasm is carefully pH balanced.
