ðŸ¤¿ Dive Buddies


Security is a team sport, even if half the team thinks PowerPoint is a deployment tool. Dive Buddies is where I talk about the human side of working in tech: leadership without management, mentoring juniors (or jaded seniors), building trust with stakeholders, and navigating the emotional tax of being the voice of caution in a go-fast culture.

I don't pretend to have all the answersâ€”but I do believe that good culture beats good tooling, every time. These are posts for those who carry both a runbook and a coffee for someone else.
