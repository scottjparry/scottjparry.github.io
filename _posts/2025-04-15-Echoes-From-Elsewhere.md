ðŸŒŠ Echoes from Elsewhere

Republished professional blogs from my employer, shared with permission.
Some of my most thoughtful work is created as part of my role with clients and teams across the industry. Echoes from Elsewhere is a space to thoughtfully reshare selected professional blogs originally published through my employerâ€”reproduced here with full permission and attribution.
These posts reflect the same voice and perspective you'll find across the rest of the blog, focused on delivering practical insights, strategic thinking, and clarity around cloud security. Whether you're discovering them here for the first time or revisiting with fresh eyes, the aim remains the same: actionable value for security architects, technologists, and leaders.
