What's up? **Looks at the sky** - yeah I know...its a bad joke- you'll get used to it...

If we haven’t met before, my name is Scott. I’m a recovering Systems Engineer turned Cloud Architect, working for a leading Microsoft Partner in Sydney. I spend my (work) days adapting to and navigating the shifting currents of cloud security.​

# The Cuttlefish

By now, you’re probably wondering why I chose a cuttlefish as our guide on this cybersecurity journey. If you’re not, then this whole paragraph has no point, and that would be a shame.​

I initially considered a raccoon—you know, looks permanently exhausted, always has its hands full, and there's a non-zero chance it might bite you!​

But I realized that the cuttlefish better embodies the modern cybersecurity team. They don't rely on brute force or thick armor like a saltie; they survive through intelligence and the ability to adapt to any situation… and they're kind of clever. Sound familiar?​

Yes… you just got compared to a cephalopod! In a good way, I promise…​

# What makes me tick?

I’ve got my tentacles dipped into several digital ponds:​
- I wrestle with Microsoft Azure until it behaves.
- I fortify Microsoft 365 environments (but still keep them usable).
- I make sense (or try to) of cybersecurity frameworks and eliminate the headaches.
- I build cloud security solutions that work in the real world, not just the ivory tower.

# Why am I writing

Honestly, we've all endured those mind-numbing presentations where we have no idea what's being discussed. It's acronym soup with a side of jargon, and at this point, you're not even sure they're speaking English.​

I know there's a better way.​

Security doesn't have to be scary, cloud computing doesn't have to be cloudy (hmmm – I'll work on that), and frameworks don't need to be oppressive.​

I want cybersecurity to be accessible to anyone who works with technology. My pet peeve is when people say, "It's not my job" or "I don't understand." I'm making it my mission to make cybersecurity more accessible.​

# What you can expect here

This blog will strive to cut through the noise. We're not playing buzzword bingo, and we won't participate in fear-mongering.​

What we will do is:​
- Provide practical security advice from the Mariana (mmmm Marinara) trenches.
- Share the adventures and misadventures of cybersecurity.
- Break down cybersecurity frameworks in a way that actually makes sense.
- Tackle cloud conundrums and their solutions without the wet blanket.
- Include lots of terrible puns and animal references that will (hopefully) make sense to you as well

# Pull up a chair

Whether you're a hardened security veteran, curious about what makes the cloud tick, or even if you work in sales (I won't judge), you're welcome here. We'll explore together, share some laughs, and try to find better ways to do this.​

I'm just going to duck off and make a coffee (my favorite is "Lots"), and then we can dive in and explore cybersecurity with less doom and gloom and more "Ah, I get it now!"​
