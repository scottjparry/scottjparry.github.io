What's up? **Looks at the sky** - yeah I know...its a bad joke- you'll get used to it...

If you haven't met me before my name is Scott, I'm a recovering Systems Engineer turned Cloud Architect working for a leading Microsoft Partner in Sydney. I spend my (work) days adapting to and navigating the shifting currents of cloud security.

# The Cuttlefish

By now you're wondering why I chose a cuttlefish as our guide on this cybersecurity journey. If you're not, then the whole paragraph has no point and that would be a shame. I was initially thinking a Racoon, you know, looks permanently exhausted, always has its hands full, non-zero chance that it might bite you! I realised that the Cuttlefish better embodies the modern cybersecurity team, they dont rely on brute force or thick armor like a saltie, they survive through their intelligence, ability to adapt to any situation...and they are kind of clever, sound familiar to you?

Yes...you just got compared to a cephalapod! In a good way I promise...

# What makes me tick?

I've got my tentacles dipped into several digital ponds
- I wrestling with Microsoft Azure until it behaves
- I fortify Microsoft 365 environments (but still keep them usable)
- I make sense (or try to) of cybersecurity frameworks and get rid of the headaches
- I build cloud security solutions that work in the real world and not just the ivory tower.
- Musing on technical leadership and what that actually means.

# Why am I writing

Honestly, we have all been through the same mind-numbind presentations where we have no ..... idea what is being talked about, its acronym soup with a side of jargon and at this point you're not even sure they are speaking english. I know their is a btter way. Security does not have to scary, cloud computing doesnt have to be cloudy (hmmm - ill work on that) and Frameworks dont need to be oppersive.

I want cybersecurity to be accessible to anyone that works with technology, my pet peeve is when people say "its not my job" or "I don't understand", i'm making it my mission to make cybersecurity more accessible.

# What you can expect here

This blog will try and cut through the noise, we aren't playing buzzword bingo, we wont participating in fear mongering.

What we will try and do it

- Provide practical security advice from the Mariana (mmmmm Marinara) trenches
- The adventures and misadventures of cybersecurity
- Breakdowns of cybersecurity frameworks which actually make sense
- Cloud Conundrems and their solutions without the wet blanket
- Lots of terrible puns and animal references which hopefully make sense to you as well.

# Pull up a chair

Whether you're a harded security veteran, curious about what makes the cloud tech or even if you work in sales (I wont judge) you're welcome here. We'll explore together, share some laughs and try and find some better ways to do this.

I'm just going to duck off and make a coffee (My favourite is "Lots") and then we can dive in and explore Cybersecurity, with less doom and gloom and more "Ah, I get it now!"
