# 🐠 Snorkelling: Getting Started with Microsoft Cloud Security

{:toc}

**Welcome to the reef. It’s bright, busy, and occasionally bites.**

If you’ve ever looked at Microsoft’s cloud security stack and felt overwhelmed—relax. You don’t need a million certs, a rack of gear, or clearance from ASIO. What you *do* need are a few essential tools, a healthy dose of curiosity, and the philosophical fortitude of one very strange animal.

Let’s begin.

## 🧰 1. A Laptop (Not Fancy, Just Functional)

You don’t need a 96-core monster with RGB lighting and a GPU capable of rendering Middle-earth. A solid laptop with a modern browser, a decent CPU, and a willingness to multitask is more than enough.

## 📚 2. Documentation (The Microsoft Kind)

Your new best friend is the [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/) platform. Bookmark the docs for Defender for Cloud, Entra ID, Intune, and the Security Compliance toolkit.

## 💻 3. VS Code (or Something Equally Sassy)

You'll be scripting policies, writing JSON, and poking Graph API with a stick. Visual Studio Code is your lightweight Swiss Army knife. Install extensions for:
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
- Bicep
- PowerShell
- Markdown

Bonus: add GitHub integration.

## 🦆 4. An Insatiable Need to Know (Activate Your Inner Platypus)

You’ll need one key trait to thrive in Microsoft Cloud Security: **curiosity**. Channel your inner **platypus**—a creature that lays eggs, senses electromagnetic fields, and has venom.

It’s weird, underestimated, and perfectly adapted to thrive where few others can.  
So should you be.
