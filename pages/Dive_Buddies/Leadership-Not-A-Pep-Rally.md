# Leadership Isn't Always a Pep Rally: Sometimes It's Just Good Process

When people talk about "leadership" in tech (and especially in IT project work), the conversation often splits into two camps.

Thereâ€™s the Chipper Brigade:

- Always smiling
- Always upbeat
- Always talking about "synergy" and "transformational journeys"
- Probably has a spreadsheet color-coded by the phases of the moon

And then thereâ€™s people like me:

- Direct, measured
- Focused on the outcome, not the parade
- Calmly skeptical because, well, weâ€™ve seen things
- More "let's execute well" than "let's all feel amazing while burning down scope"

Hereâ€™s the truth: both approaches can work. But one of them tends to survive real-world IT projects with fewer therapy bills.

## Leadership, Without the Pom-Poms
Thanks to a slightly unusual combination of strengths (Gallup's Deliberative, Responsibility, Relator, Analytical, Learner, and a healthy dash of Command), and a neurodivergent brain wired for pattern detection, I approach leadership a little differently:

- **I don't pretend problems aren't there.**
Leadership isn't about ignoring risk. It's about managing it deliberately, responsibly, with eyes wide open.

- **I don't need everyone to "feel amazing" all the time.**
I need everyone to know what their job is, have the support to do it, and be able to escalate real issues without fear of being told to "just stay positive."

- **I'm not obsessed with being the loudest voice in the room.**
I'm obsessed with the signal-to-noise ratio. Good leadership is making sure communication cuts through cleanly, not making everyone louder.

In short, Iâ€™m not the glass-half-full leader, nor the glass-half-empty one. Iâ€™m the "who's in charge of topping up the glass?" leader. It's the difference between optimism and operational reality.

## Most IT Projects Are Simple â€” If You Manage the Process
Hereâ€™s the dirty little secret of most IT projects, especially in cloud and security:

- **The technology is not the hard part.**
Vendors (and engineers) like to act like it is because it makes them feel important, but if you can read and click a mouse, most modern platforms are straightforward (after the 15th acronym, anyway).

- **Managing change is the hard part.**
People. Expectations. Timelines. The process around change. Communication. Handling resistance without letting it fester into sabotage. Thatâ€™s where projects live or die.

- **Communication is not the same as cheerleading.**
Communication is making sure people know whatâ€™s happening, when, why it matters to them, and what to expect next. It's setting clear expectations, not inflating them with empty positivity.

So when I "lead," itâ€™s not with relentless smiles or rah-rah speeches. Itâ€™s with deliberate planning, direct communication, and ruthless clarity on what matters. That's what builds trust. That's what drives outcomes. Thatâ€™s what gets projects done.

## The Velvet Hammer Approach
Iâ€™ve been described as a "velvet hammer" â€” direct but not cruel, firm but fair, outcomes-focused without trampling people.

**Thatâ€™s leadership too.**
It just looks less like a TED talk and more like an architect quietly pointing out where the foundation needs to be reinforced before the house collapses.

And honestly?

In IT (and especially in security), Iâ€™d rather be the architect than the hype man.
