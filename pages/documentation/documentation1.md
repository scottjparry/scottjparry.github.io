# Geting started

"The journey of a thousand miles begins beneath one tentacle," the cuttlefish thought to itself, "We do not take steps, but rather suggestions of movement; we do not follow paths, but rather drift where the currents take us."

The creature's skin rippled with limitless colourr as it contemplated the impossible of the journey ahead, knowing that even the inkiest black depths of the sea were merely the beginning of the true voyageâ€”the one that occurs within the labyrinth of a cephalapods mind!

So you know that you want to start learning about "the cloud" but you're not sure where you should start?

Let me tell you the same thing our cephalapod friend here would say, start at the beginning.

The dirty secret of the industry is that cloud computing, its exactly the same as on-prem computing, you're just using someone elses computer. A while there is a bit more intricacy to it than that, really, thats the secret.

If you are able to understand how computers, systems, networks, programming languages and coffee machines work, you will always be able to find a job. Yes, all of those are critical, technology teams run on caffeine, its a little known fact.
