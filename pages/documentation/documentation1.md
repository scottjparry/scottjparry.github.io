# Geting started

"The journey of a thousand miles begins beneath one tentacle," the cuttlefish thought to itself, "We do not take steps, but rather suggestions of movement; we do not follow paths, but rather drift where the currents take us."

The creature's skin rippled with limitless colourr as it contemplated the impossible of the journey ahead, knowing that even the inkiest black depths of the sea were merely the beginning of the true voyageâ€”the one that occurs within the labyrinth of a cephalapods mind!

So you know that you want to start learning about "the cloud" but you're not sure where you should start?

Let me tell you the same thing our cephalapod friend here would say, start at the beginning.

The dirty secret of the industry is that cloud computing, its exactly the same as on-prem computing, you're just using someone elses computer. A while there is a bit more intricacy to it than that, really, thats the secret.

If you are able to understand how computers, systems, networks, programming languages and coffee machines work, you will always be able to find a job. Yes, all of those are critical, technology teams run on caffeine, its a little known fact.

# What is this?

Well, this is an introduction into the world on Microsoft Cloud and its many facets, lets have a look around shall we?

First you have Azure, where global powerhouses have moved their datacentres. There millions of processes, petabytes of ram and more storage than I know how to count, all humming along to deliver value to business. Then their is Microsoft 365, with its SharePoint sites full of documents, Teams channesl full of cat gifs, Emails in Exchange Online and even the new kids on the block like Microsoft Loop. You have EntraId (The artist formerly known as Azure Active Directory), the brains behind a lot of this, it managers the identities of businesses all over the globe, whether its for Finance, HR or Technology teams, or if its a External Tenant where your customers can create accounts for the application you've built.
